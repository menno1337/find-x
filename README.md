# find-x
Find-x is a equation game. The sole purpose is to solve all equations by using the same terms on both side of the equation. The funpart about the game is, that you can interact with the mathematical rules, without breaking them.

Example: 
You see the equation x+9=13. 
By subtracting the value 9, you get the result: x+9-9 = 13-9. 
Then you have to drag and grop the +9 and the -9, because the are neighbours you can just swipe right from the +9 and you get the result: 
x = 13-9. 
Now you have to swipe right from 13 and you geht the result: x=4, and the equation is solved. 

You are allowed to do most algebraic transformations, but the will be revieled only after a few of simple equations and are seen as rewards for your previous work.
